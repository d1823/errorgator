# Errorgator

A simple application monitoring alternative.

## Status

At this moment, Errorgator is a work in progress project.

## About

Errorgator is a simple application monitoring alternative to some more complex products like Sentry, Loggly, or
self-hosted ELK stack. It offers a very simple event capturing API, as well as corresponding SDKs for Monolog and
JavaScript. It differs from other solutions in its intended use case. Its main goal isn't supporting any high-scale
systems as other platforms are already doing it flawlessly. Instead, it tries to offer itself to developers searching
for a simple, self-hosted application allowing them to aggregate logs and errors from various sources and search through
them via an easy-to-use GUI.

## Contribution

This project's sources are publicly available under the 3-Clause BSD license because I believe there's someone that
might benefit from this program. That said, it doesn't change the fact it's made by me, for me. As much as I appreciate
other people getting involved in community projects, I don't have the time or motivation to manage Errorgator as such.
That's why I consciously disabled issues. If you found a bug or feel a particular feature would be useful, and you're
willing to invest your own time to submit it as a PR, feel free to do so as it's much appreciated.

## License
